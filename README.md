Finance Report Dashboard

Hello Everyone,

I made this Finance Dashboard in Power BI with the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft on their Website.

## Problem Statement

- The goal of this Power BI Dashboard Project is to analyze a company's financial performance using the provided Microsoft Sample Data.

- To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

## Sections in the Report

*Report has Multiple Sections from where you can manage the Data, Like :*

- Segments, Country, and Year can slice Report Data to show Particular Data.

- It has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sales, and Total Profit.

- It has a Clustered Bar Chart with Year on the X-axis and Profit on the Y-axis showing Profit Quarterly.

- Lastly, It has an Area Chart showing Months on the X-axis and Profit on the Y-axis showing profit Monthly.

- I have also included a Reset Button at the Top to clear all Slicers.

- To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset the Slicer's.
