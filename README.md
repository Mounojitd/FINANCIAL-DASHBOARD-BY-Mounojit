Finance Report Dashboard
Hello Everyone,

I made this Finance Dashboard in Power BI with the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft on their Website.

Problem Statement
The goal of this Power BI Dashboard Project is to analyze the financial performance of a company using the provided Microsoft Sample Data.

To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

Sections in the Report
Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like :

Report Data can be sliced by Segments, Country and Year to show Particular Data.

It has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale and Total Profit.

It has a Clustered Bar Chart with Year on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing Profit Quarterly.

And Lastly, It has a Area Chart showing Months on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing profit Monthly.

I have also included a Reset Button at the Top to clear all Slicer's.

To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset the Slicer's.
